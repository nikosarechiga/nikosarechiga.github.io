Hello! I am a Senior Research Scientist at Toyota Research Institute. I work on using generative AI with a focus on two core application areas.
- Physics-informed generative AI for engineering design.
- Using large language models to better understand human behavior.
  
I have a PhD from Carnegie Mellon on using logic-based AI for enginering design and automation, advised by Prof. Bruce Krogh.
